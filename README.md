## About The Project

Platyrhynchos is a project centred around creating word-centric crossword generation algorithms. This can be viewed as an alternative to methods that focus on generating matrices filled with letters and mutating them to make them into crosswords.

### 0.9 release approaches

The first method combines first improvement and best improvement local search methods to concatenate together crosswords. The choice of which one to use is made using the temperature calculated for a given turn. The second algorithm is a simulated annealing algorithm which uses best improvement search and word removal operation. The crosswords are evaluated using a goal function that includes the number of intersections and the density of letters in the crossword.

### Our new approach

Currently, we are investigating a "smart" word insertion method that finds the worst rows and columns and tries to improve their score.

## Built With

- DuckDB
- Python
- PyTest
- Poetry
- tqdm
- functiontrace
- [A Dataset of Cryptic Crossword Clues](https://cryptics.georgeho.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Make sure to have Python 3.10 and Poetry installed
2. Run any of the scripts using `poetry run ...`

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/letterfowl/Platyrhynchos/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**, but please make sure to get in contact with the authors:
* If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/letterfowl/Platyrhynchos/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes.
* Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
* Create individual PR for each suggestion.
